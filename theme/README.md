# Theme templates

Place the provided HTML/CSS assets from `theme/admin` and `theme/front` here. These are copied into the runtime `public/admin-theme/` and `public/theme/` directories by `scripts/sync_theme.php`. If you checked out a branch without the uploaded templates, switch to the branch that contains them (usually `main`) or copy them in manually before syncing.

If you pulled the repo with the theme folder already populated, just run the sync script after install to mirror the files into the served locations.
