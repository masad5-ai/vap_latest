# Theme templates

Place the provided HTML/CSS assets from `theme/admin` and `theme/front` here. These are copied into the runtime `public/admin-theme/` and `public/theme/` directories by `scripts/sync_theme.php`.

If you pulled the repo with the theme folder already populated, just run the sync script after install to mirror the files into the served locations.
